# RoR2_Mods
A collaborative effort to learn C#, Unity &amp; 3D modeling. Risk of Rain 2 is a great starting point towards learning how to properly develop game code.
Development goals:
- Build custom item(s) to develop understanding of C#, RoR2 code, Unity &amp; 3D modeling
- Build a custom character into the game with knowledge learned from previous goal
